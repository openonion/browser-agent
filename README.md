# Playwright Web Automation Agent

A natural language browser automation agent powered by ConnectOnion and Playwright.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openonion/browser-agent.git
cd browser-agent

# Run the setup script (installs everything)
./setup.sh

# Test it - just run this one command
python agent.py
```

That's it! The agent will open a browser, visit Hacker News, take a screenshot, and close the browser.

### Manual Setup (if you prefer)

```bash
# 1. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Initialize ConnectOnion project
co init

# 3. Install Playwright browsers
playwright install

# 4. Authenticate with ConnectOnion
co auth
```

### What the Setup Script Does

The `setup.sh` script automatically:
- Installs all Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Initializes the ConnectOnion project (creates `.co/` directory)
- Installs Playwright browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Sets up authentication (creates `.env` with your API key)

## Use in Your Code

```python
from agent import agent

# Just give it natural language commands
result = agent.input("Go to google.com and search for AI news")
print(result)
```

## Features

- 🌐 **Natural language browser control** - Just describe what you want
- 📸 **Automatic screenshots** - Capture any page state
- 🔍 **Smart element finding** - No CSS selectors needed
- 📝 **Form automation** - Fill and submit forms intelligently
- 🎯 **Multi-step workflows** - Complex automation sequences
- 🔐 **Chrome profile support** - Use your cookies, sessions, and login states

## How It Works

1. **Natural Language Input**: You describe what you want in plain English
2. **AI Planning**: The agent understands and plans the browser actions
3. **Tool Execution**: Playwright performs the actual browser control
4. **Result Reporting**: Agent reports what was done at each step

## Examples

```python
from agent import agent

# Simple navigation
agent.input("Open browser and go to news.ycombinator.com, then close")

# Search automation
agent.input("Go to google.com, search for ConnectOnion, take a screenshot, close browser")

# Form filling
agent.input("Go to example.com/contact, fill name with John Doe, fill email with john@example.com, submit, close browser")
```

## How to Extend

Add new methods to `WebAutomation` class in `web_automation.py`:

```python
@xray
def scroll_down(self) -> str:
    """Scroll down the page."""
    if not self.page:
        return "Browser not open"
    self.page.evaluate("window.scrollBy(0, 500)")
    return "Scrolled down"
```

The agent automatically uses new methods based on natural language commands.

## Chrome Profile Support

By default, the agent uses your Chrome profile data (cookies, sessions, logins). This means:

- ✅ **Stay logged in** - Access sites where you're already authenticated
- ✅ **No conflicts** - Your regular Chrome can stay open while agent runs
- ✅ **Fast** - First run copies profile (~50s), subsequent runs are instant
- ✅ **Private** - Profile copy stored locally in `chrome_profile_copy/` (gitignored)

### How It Works

On first run, the agent copies essential Chrome profile data to `./chrome_profile_copy/`:
- Cookies and sessions
- Saved passwords (encrypted)
- Bookmarks and history
- Extensions (skips cache for speed)

Subsequent runs reuse this copy, so startup is fast.

### Disable Chrome Profile

To use a fresh browser without your Chrome data:

```python
# In agent.py, line 21
web = WebAutomation(use_chrome_profile=False)
```

### Update Profile Copy

To get latest cookies/sessions from your Chrome:

```bash
rm -rf chrome_profile_copy/
python agent.py  # Will create fresh copy
```

## Run Tests

```bash
python tests/test_all.py
