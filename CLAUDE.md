# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **natural language browser automation agent** built with ConnectOnion and Playwright. It transforms natural language commands like "go to Google and search for AI news" into executable browser actions. The agent follows the ConnectOnion philosophy: "Keep simple things simple, make complicated things possible."

## Core Architecture

### Two-Layer Design

1. **Web Automation Layer** (`web_automation.py`):
   - `WebAutomation` class provides browser control primitives
   - All methods decorated with `@xray` for behavior tracking
   - AI-powered element finding using `find_element_by_description()`
   - Form handling, screenshots, navigation, data extraction

2. **Agent Layer** (`agent.py`):
   - ConnectOnion Agent orchestrates tool calls
   - Natural language understanding via LLM (gemini-2.5-flash by default)
   - System prompt defines agent personality (`prompt.md`)
   - Interactive CLI and automated task modes

### Key Design Pattern

**Functions as Tools**: All `WebAutomation` methods automatically become agent tools. No manual tool registration needed - just pass the class instance:

```python
web = WebAutomation()
agent = Agent(
    name="playwright_agent",
    tools=web,  # All methods become tools
    max_iterations=20
)
```

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install python-dotenv playwright connectonion
playwright install

# Authenticate with ConnectOnion (creates .env with OPENONION_API_KEY)
co auth
```

### Running the Agent

```bash
# Interactive mode - starts a chat session
python agent.py

# Automated task from command line
python agent.py "Open browser, go to news.ycombinator.com, take a screenshot"
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run complete test suite (4 tests: auth, browser, agent control, search)
python tests/test_all.py

# Run from project root
python -m tests.test_all

# Individual test files
python tests/direct_test.py
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Natural Language Element Finding

Located in `web_automation.py:71` - `find_element_by_description()`:
- Takes natural language descriptions ("the blue submit button")
- Uses `llm_do()` to analyze HTML and generate CSS selectors
- Validates selector works on page before returning
- Falls back to text matching if AI approach fails

This is the core innovation that makes the agent feel natural to use.

### AI-Powered Tools Pattern

The agent uses ConnectOnion's `llm_do()` helper for intelligent operations:
- `find_element_by_description()`: Convert descriptions to selectors
- `analyze_page()`: Answer questions about page content
- `smart_fill_form()`: Generate appropriate form values from user info

These tools combine traditional automation (Playwright) with AI reasoning.

### Screenshot Workflow

Per `prompt.md` guidelines, the agent should:
1. Take screenshots after navigation
2. Take screenshots of empty forms before filling
3. Take screenshots after filling forms
4. Take screenshots after submission
5. Save all screenshots to `screenshots/` directory (auto-created)

### Browser Lifecycle

- Browser opens on first navigation command
- Stays open during interactive sessions
- Auto-closes at end of automated tasks
- Manual close via `close()` tool or "Close the browser" command

## Environment Configuration

### Required
```bash
# Created automatically by `co auth`
OPENONION_API_KEY=your_token_here
```

### ConnectOnion Project Metadata
- Stored in `.co/config.toml`
- Agent address, email, default model settings
- Do not modify manually - managed by `co` CLI

## Code Patterns to Follow

### Adding New Browser Tools

1. Add method to `WebAutomation` class
2. Decorate with `@xray` for behavior tracking
3. Return descriptive strings, not just success/failure
4. Handle `self.page is None` gracefully

Example:
```python
@xray
def hover_over(self, description: str) -> str:
    """Hover over an element using natural language description."""
    if not self.page:
        return "Browser not open"

    try:
        selector = self.find_element_by_description(description)
        if selector.startswith("Could not"):
            return selector

        self.page.hover(selector)
        return f"Hovered over '{description}'"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Hover failed: {str(e)}"
```

### Error Handling Philosophy

From global CLAUDE.md: Try-except is sometimes over-engineering. Only catch exceptions when you need to provide user-friendly error messages. Otherwise, let errors bubble up to the agent for retry.

### Model Selection

- Default: `gemini-2.5-flash` (fast, cost-effective)
- For complex HTML analysis: `co/gpt-4o` (higher accuracy)
- For testing: `co/o4-mini` (cheapest option)
- All models use ConnectOnion managed keys (`co/` prefix)

## Testing Strategy

### Test Structure (`tests/test_all.py`)

Four-stage validation:
1. **Authentication**: Verify ConnectOnion tokens work
2. **Direct Browser**: Test `WebAutomation` methods directly
3. **Agent Browser**: Test agent tool orchestration
4. **Google Search**: End-to-end complex workflow

Each test is independent and reports pass/fail clearly.

### Adding New Tests

Follow the pattern:
```python
def test_feature_name():
    """Test 5: Description of what this tests."""
    print("\n5️⃣  Testing Feature Name")
    print("-" * 40)

    try:
        # Setup
        web = WebAutomation()
        agent = Agent(name="test", model="co/o4-mini", tools=web)

        # Execute
        result = agent.input("task description")
        print(f"✅ Success: {result[:100]}...")

        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Failed: {e}")
        return False
```

Then add to `tests` list in `main()`.

## Common Workflows

### Interactive Session
```python
python agent.py
# User types: "Go to example.com and take a screenshot"
# Agent opens browser → navigates → screenshots → reports
```

### Automated Task
```python
python agent.py "Fill out the contact form at example.com/contact with name: John Doe, email: john@example.com"
# Agent completes full workflow → closes browser → exits
```

### Adding Custom Tools
```python
# In web_automation.py
@xray
def scroll_to_bottom(self) -> str:
    """Scroll to the bottom of the page."""
    if not self.page:
        return "Browser not open"
    self.page.evaluate("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)")
    return "Scrolled to bottom"

# Agent automatically uses this when user says "scroll down"
```

## Important Behaviors

### Agent Philosophy (from prompt.md)
- **Understand intent, not syntax**: "sign in to GitHub" means navigate + find button + click
- **Report what you do**: Clear status updates at each step
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Try alternatives before giving up
- **Be proactive**: Take screenshots, extract data automatically

### What NOT to Do
- Don't expose CSS selectors to users
- Don't ask users for technical details
- Don't leave browsers open after automated tasks
- Don't use try-except everywhere (see philosophy above)

## Troubleshooting

### "No authentication token found"
Run `co auth` - this creates `.env` with `OPENONION_API_KEY`

### "Playwright not installed"
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

### Browser doesn't appear
- Tests run in headless mode by default
- For debugging: `WebAutomation(headless=False)` in agent.py

### Element not found errors
- AI element finder works ~80% of time
- Falls back to text matching automatically
- Complex dynamic sites may need custom selectors

## Design Philosophy Alignment

This project embodies ConnectOnion principles:

1. **Simple things simple**: `agent.input("search for AI news")` just works
2. **Complicated things possible**: Custom tools, AI-powered selectors, multi-step workflows
3. **Functions as primitives**: All tools are just Python methods
4. **Behavior tracking**: `@xray` decorator logs all actions to `~/.connectonion/`

The user should feel like they're talking to a helpful assistant, not programming a robot.
